# Minutes of February 2020 Meetup
# 2020-02-26

Adapted from [Dieter's notes](https://github.com/dkluenter/emacs/blob/master/minutes-26-02-20.md)

At the MeetUp session on Feb. 26.2020 some topics where discussed,
this are a few minutes that I can remember . :(

###  change of $EMACS_HOME and $XDG_CONF_HOME directories

+  `~/.emacs.d/` could be kept
+  `~/.config/emacs/` might be required if XDG interferes

+   themes integration, security problem?
+  `(require 'cl)` is obsolete, should be `(require 'cl-lib)`

###  Markdown-Mode

A few lines frome my init.el

```
   ((autoload 'markdown-mode "markdown-mode"
   "Major mode for editing Markdown files" t)

   (autoload 'pandoc-mode "Minor Mode for Markdown" t)
   (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.md\\'" . markdown-mode))`

   (add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'pandoc-load-default-settings)
   (add-hook 'pandoc-mode-hook 'pandoc-load-default-settings)
```

With regard to *pandoc*, install a binary which 'markdown-mode'
will require in order to compile files.
Markdown produces restructured text, while Pandoc transforms restructured
text to printable format like PDF and HTML.

### Kill entire Line

 This lisp code is based on my old XEmacs configuration from the
  late 90's

```
    (defun Init-kill-entire-line (&optional arg)
    "Kill the entire line.
    With prefix argument, kill that many lines from point.  Negative
    arguments kill lines backward.
    When calling from a program, nil means \"no arg\",
    a number counts as a prefix arg."
    (interactive "*P")
    (let ((kill-whole-line t))
    (beginning-of-line)
    (call-interactively 'kill-line)))
    (global-set-key [f8]
    (if (fboundp 'kill-entire-line)
     kill-entire-line 'Init-kill-entire-line))
```
